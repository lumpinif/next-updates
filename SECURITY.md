# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security issue, please report it privately.

- Preferred: GitHub Security Advisories (if this repository is hosted on GitHub)
- Alternative: open an issue only if the impact is clearly non-sensitive

If you need an email contact, add it here once the repo is public.
